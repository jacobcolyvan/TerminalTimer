# Simple terminal timer/reminder program using Ruby
Intended for managing simple/reminder execution to follow pomodoro schedules. <br>
Sends system notifications when starting and finishing (osx only). Prints a countdown every 10 seconds in terminal. <br>
<br>
I made it to use with Alfred launcher, to set up easy timers directly from the launcher. <br>

Requires no gems for setups, and takes a command line number argument as input.
